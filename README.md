# Non-parametric Recursive Estimation of the Copula Density

The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First of all, we introduced an algorithm that estimates the joint density function using the smoothed non-parametric recursive estimator. Secondly, for the first time, we present a smoothed non-parametric recursive estimator for a multivariate copula density, a joint distribution that can capture complex dependence structures among its variates. Also, we present the numerical results that show an apparent convergence of these estimators.
